# Terms & conditions component task

Write an Angular 2+ or React application component that shows a (Terms and conditions) like
section, where you have to confirm reading and get Ok button, the trick is you canâ€™t press the
button (disabled) unless you reach the bottom of the Terms.
The component should be generic, you should be able to create contents dynamically, and pass
the condition of the button activation dynamically.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`
